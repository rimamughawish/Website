*Blogpost 1*

One of the most interesting topics to me was the interaction between R and Python. It is amazing that we can run Python code in R. In this blog post I will be showing how that can be possible.

Usually in R markdown, when we try to run a code, we create a code chunk which can be done by adding three backticks followed by curly brakets containing the letter R; like this (```{R}). This chunk is closed by adding three more backticks at the end of the chunk. Inside the chunk we can write the code and it is run by R.

```{R}
2+2
7*50
4/5
```
In order to run a python code in R, all we have to do is replace the letter R in the curly brakets with the word Python, like this (```{Python}). The chunk is closed the same way with the three back ticks at the end of the chunk.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
hi <- "hello"
```

```{Python}
2+2
7*50
4/5
```

One difference there is between the two codes is that when we run the python chunk in R we cannot see the output in the markdown file. Instead we see it when the file is knitted out.

Let's play with this for a little

```{Python}
#Creating a dictionary
UTs_dict = {
  'Buildings':['SAC', 'PCL', 'Tower', 'NHB', 'BUR'],
  'size':'437 acres',
  'Motto': ['What Starts Here Changes the world', 'hookem']
}

UTs_dict['Motto'].append('You Belong Here')

print(UTs_dict)

```
